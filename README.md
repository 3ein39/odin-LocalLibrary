# LocalLibrary Express Practice Project

This project serves as a practice ground for learning and experimenting with the Mongoose ODM (Object Data Modeling), MongoDB, and Express.js. It also demonstrates the use of the Express Application Generator tool for quickly setting up an Express application.

## Project Overview

The **LocalLibrary Express Practice Project** is designed to help developers improve their skills in building web applications using popular technologies:

- **Express.js**: A fast, unopinionated web framework for Node.js.
- **Mongoose**: An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing and managing data.

## Functionalities

This project focuses on the following key functionalities:

1. **Library Catalog**: It simulates a basic library catalog, where users can:
   - Browse available books.
   - View book details, including title, author, and availability.

2. **Express Application Generator**: The project is scaffolded using the Express Application Generator, which provides a starting point for an Express.js application.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Set up a MongoDB database and configure the connection in your `.env` file.
5. Start the application using `npm start`.
